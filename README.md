## Next Steps

I'm always looking to improve the Float Calculator! Upcoming enhancements include:

- **Improved Mobile Optimisation:** Addressing current issues where input fields trigger zooming on mobile devices, leading to label visibility problems. My next priority is to refine the mobile layout for optimal viewing and usability on all screen sizes.
